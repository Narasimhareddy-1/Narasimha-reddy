# 🎯 Loopstudios Landing Page – Frontend Mentor Challenge

This project is a fully responsive landing page built based on the [Frontend Mentor Loopstudios challenge](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/loopstudios-landing-page-N88J5Onjw). It showcases strong foundational skills in **HTML** and **CSS**, with a mobile-first, clean design approach and a tiny touch of **JavaScript** for mobile navigation interactivity.
